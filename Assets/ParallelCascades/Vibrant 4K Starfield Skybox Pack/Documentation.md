# Vibrant 4K Starfield Skybox Pack

## Contents
This asset contains 4 static cubemap skyboxes with vibrant space backgrounds:

- Simple Starfield with Flaring Stars
- Vibrant Space Skybox 1 ( Nebulas + Galaxy)
- Vibrant Space Skybox 2 (Nebulas + Galaxy)
- Vibrant Space Skybox 3 (Nebulas)

All skyboxes have been rendered from procedural shaders to ensure natural-looking nebulas and star distributions. No AI has been used to create this asset.

Each skybox is built from 6 4096x4096px images. The skyboxes cover the entire spherical field of view and can be used to create a space or sci-fi aesthetic in any 3D project quickly.

This package can be used with Built-in Render Pipeline and Universal Render Pipeline. It does not support the High Definition Render Pipeline.

## How to Use
To apply a skybox in a scene you can either:
1. Drag and drop the desired skybox material onto the background
of the scene view and the skybox should update automatically.
2. Place the material in the Window>Rendering>Lighting>Environment>Skybox material slot.
3. Add the Skybox component on a desired camera in the scene, and apply the skybox material in the Material slot. Note 
that this method will only affect the camera it is attached to, and the skybox will not show up in the scene view.

## Adjusting brightness
The skyboxes have been tuned for a backlit LCD monitor. If the skybox is too bright or too dark,
the Exposure parameter inside each Skybox material can be adjusted.
